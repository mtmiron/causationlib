Personal backup of some theories in a uselessly-early state (i.e. nothing to see here, move on -- if you don't, at least pardon the portions that are a half-designed mess)

This is a collection of simulations and implementations of theoretical frameworks.  Usefulness is neither guaranteed nor provided; a deeper understanding on the part of the author is, however, selfishly maximized with no concern whatsoever for any other parameters.
