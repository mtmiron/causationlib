# causationlib
Personal backup of some theories in a uselessly-early state (i.e. nothing to see here, move on)

This is a collection of simulations and implementations of theoretical frameworks.  Usefulness is neither guaranteed nor provided; a deeper understanding on the part of the author is, however, selfishly maximized with no concern whatsoever for any other parameters.

Note that the TimeQueue functions from the tortoise library are not generic -- they're designed to function with the neural net code, and it will not postpone events until the arbitrary time provided (it perfectly preserves the chain of causality through time, but it does not postpone execution of events until a given time.)
